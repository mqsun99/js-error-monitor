# JavaScript Error Handling and Monitoring 
To learn how to deal with errors a bit better I explored JavaScript error handling by implementing:
- More advanced use of console object including console.log, console.error, console.table, console.dir, console.dirxml, console.group (includes related functions to use properly), console.time / console.timeEnd,  and console.trace.
- Use of try/catch/finally
- Use of throw
- Use of Custom Error messages 
- Custom errors, extending Error
- Use of 3rd Party JavaScript monitoring services 
- - JavaScript Error Logging
